To solve this, increase the specificity of the selector targeting paragraphs outside the div.  One way to do this is to add an extra class to those paragraphs. 

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

.other p {
  color: red;
}
```

In your HTML, apply the class 'other' to paragraphs not nested within a div:

```html
<div>
  <p>This paragraph should be blue.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph should be blue (due to inheritance).</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="other">This paragraph should be red.</p>
```

Alternatively, you can use the `!important` flag, but this is generally discouraged due to potential maintainability issues:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important;
}
```
